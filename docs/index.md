## Sanitizes Indicators of Compromise

Defang is an outlook plugin that allows you to quickly sanitize IPs, domains, and [protocol handlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_URI_schemes) while composing or receiving emails.

```
5.22.9.12  >>>  5[.]22[.]9[.]12
evil.com   >>>  evil[.]com
https://   >>>  https[:]//
```


This promotes the sharing of IOCs in a safe format that is consistently undetectable by email protections and other threat filters.
